just hundredths of a second.</div><div class=column><h3>It's open source.</h3><p>Every single part of Scripty is open source <a href=https://github.com/scripty-bot class=default-color>on GitHub</a>, from the
core bot code itself to the speech-to-text algorithm.</div><div class=column><h3>It's multilingual.</h3><p>Scripty supports 55 languages, covering 6,246,200,000 people worldwide. See a full list at our <a href=/languages.html class=default-color>languages page</a>.</div></div><div class=columns><div class=column><h3>It's easy to use.</h3><p>Set it up with one single command, and then just ask it to join a voice chat. That's it. No bullshit.</div><div class=column><h3>It's free.</h3><p>Scripty's core features will always be free, forever.</div><div class=column><h3>It's private.</h3><p>Absolutely no logs are kept about your transcriptions or audio. What happens in your server, stays in your
server.

Scripty is the only bot out there that does this all offline,
without sending any of your voice to third-parties, like Facebook or Google.
Perfect for anyone, but especially the privacy-oriented user.</div><div class=column><h3>Voice Assistant (coming soon!)</h3><p>Ever felt too lazy to Alt+Tab back into Discord just to change the music currently playing?
Scripty is the answer. If you use a supported bot, you can just say, "Hey Scripty, skip this song".
Want to customize the commands? You can do that as well, on our dashboard.</div><div class=column><h3>Voice Chat Moderation (coming soon!)</h3><p>Don't have a voice chat because you find it hard to moderate? Scripty is your solution.
Want to send a warning message when people speak offensive words? You can do that.
Need to remove users from voice chats when they break your rules? You can do that.</div></div><div class=columns><div class=column><h3>Text to Speech (coming soon!)</h3><p>You can have Scripty listen for you already, wouldn't it be great if it could speak for you as well?
We think the same thing. Scripty can speak for you, with dozens of voices, and a dazzling array of controls.</div><div class=column><h3>Custom Voice (coming soon, premium only!)</h3><p>Don't like the built-in text-to-speech voices? We've got the solution.
With a 15 second recording, we can train a new voice for you, that sounds just like you.</div><div class=column><h3>Complete Privacy</h3><p>Human voice is very complex. We don't log any data about you. We don't keep any logs, no matter if you're paying or not. Full stop.
You can always delete all the data Scripty has stored on you with just one command.</div></div></section><section class=section><h2>Still not convinced?</h2><p>Why not take a look at our comparison with the only other known transcription bot out there?</p><a href=/scripty-vs-scriptly.html class="button is-black">Scripty vs Scriptly</a></section><section class=section><h2>Got questions?</h2><p>We've got the answers.
